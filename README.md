### ü§ù PARTICIPATION

### **Ikram El Jauhari Al Jaouhari**
I have been mostly responsible for developing the functions related to the index screen for both no resgitered users and registered users including a variety of "load more" buttons with AJAX, the element detail screen, the edit user profile screen and the category screen in which I had to show specific products based on the category. Also, I have been responsible for the functions of creating and editing reviews on the element detail screen. In addition, I have participated in the developing of the security integration with the web. Last but not least, I have developed the advanced algorithm which consisted in showing more products based on the categories of the user last order

### **Alberto Mayoral G√≥mez**
I have been responsible for developing the functions related to the creation and edition of products by the administrator, as well as user management and the control of reviews reported by customers. On the other hand, I have implemented the shopping cart logic on the website, taking into account the addition, removal, and processing of items, considering the available stock and possible concurrency issues, as well as the product search bar on the main page. Additionally, I have collaborated on the security aspect regarding access to certain pages, providing error and authentication pages. Finally, I have also contributed to correcting and improving the website in general

### **Ic√≠ar Moreno L√≥pez**
I have developed the login and registration screens, managing user authentication and storage. I have also implemented the admin profile management so he/she can update his/her information easily. In addition, I have developed the order management screen, working on the logic of its creation and making sure only paid orders are shown and allowing their status to be updated. I have also implemented the generation of PDFs with order details and the automatic sending of emails to users after making a purchase. Finally, I have corrected errors and improved general aspects of the website
